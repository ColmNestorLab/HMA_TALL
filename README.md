## Abstract
Mutations in proteins that regulate DNA methylation are implicated in the development and progression of several cancers, and aberrant DNA methylation is a universal feature of neoplasia. Despite the current use of DNA hypomethylating agents (HMAs) in treating haematological malignancies, the role of altered DNA methylation patterns in cancer biology remains largely unresolved. In this study, we used a reversible DNMT1-specific inhibitor to assess the molecular effects of global DNA methylation loss in leukemic cells. We demonstrate that removal of DNA methylation has minimal impact on cell viability and does not generally upregulate transcription. Furthermore, few endogenous retroviruses become expressed following demethylation, challenging the concept of ‘viral mimicry’ as a source of toxicity. While demethylation led to the reactivation of a handful of tumour suppressor genes, it resulted in the expression of twice as many oncogenes associated with leukemic progression. Indeed, this study revealed no evidence of an epigenetic basis for the toxicity associated with FDA-approved HMAs. Together, these findings offer a nuanced understanding of the interplay between DNA methylation and transcription in cancer, offering valuable implications for future therapeutic strategies targeting aberrant DNA methylation.
